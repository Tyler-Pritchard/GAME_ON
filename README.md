# GAME_ON

Game On is a platform for indie gamers. It's a community based niche freelancer website that connects gaming founders with 
developers, voice over artists, designers, and anyone else you would need in building a game.

This project was built at a Draper University hackathon in July 2019.

The team that worked on this includes Tyler Pritchard, Arooj Sheikh, Alia Almuhanna, Abeer Almuhanna,
Abdullah Alshathri, Bandar, and Mohammed Alkhudairy.
